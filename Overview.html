      <h2>Addressing hunger is a critical global issue affecting millions of people. Food insecurity can lead to a range of health problems, social instability, and economic challenges. Helping those in need requires a multifaceted approach, including immediate relief efforts and long-term solutions.</h2>
      <h1>Our goal</h1>
      <h2>Addressing food insecurity among children in poverty in the Philippines requires a comprehensive strategy that includes public education, policy advocacy, fundraising, and partnerships with local businesses. Educating communities on the causes and impact of food insecurity can drive engagement and policy change, such as stronger social safety nets and agricultural reforms. Targeted fundraising through crowdfunding, corporate partnerships, and grants can provide immediate relief and long-term support. Collaborating with restaurants and grocery stores to redirect surplus food not only reduces waste but also creates an efficient redistribution system, ensuring more families receive the nourishment they need.</h2>
